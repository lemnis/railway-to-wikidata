# Unexpected control digits

Sometimes there is a mismatch between the calculated control digit 
(following the luhn algorithm) and the digit used in side the SNCF system.
Below are a couple of examples:

- Luxembourg, 82-00100(8), https://m.ter.sncf.com/occitanie/se-deplacer/gares/luxembourg-82001000
- Oss, 84-84495(1), https://m.ter.sncf.com/occitanie/se-deplacer/gares/oss-84844950
- Stockholm Central, 74-03751(5), https://m.ter.sncf.com/occitanie/se-deplacer/gares/stockholms-central-74037510
